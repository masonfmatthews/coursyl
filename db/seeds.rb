    %{Even if you don't realize it, databases are everywhere, and they come in
many flavors.  They're not just in the obvious places like Facebook and Twitter;
you also have hundreds installed on the phone in your hand, and chances are
that your life would be easier if you'd built a few for yourself.  This course
will introduce you to database concepts, give you experience using them
for real-world applications, and demonstrate how one size most certainly does
not fit all.

Approximately 60% of the course will be devoted to relational databases and DB
design.  The remaining 40% will cover NoSQL options such as MongoDB and Riak.}

The point: It's amazing that you all picked different ones.  You're all right that databases are really behind everything (although I can't tell you which one has the most.).

Back to it.  Here's the quote for the class:

"Databases are organized to model relevant aspects of reality in a way that supports the processes requiring their data."

Look back at the example we did in Excel.  Discuss:

- Tables
- Columns (fields)
- Rows
- Values
- Domains

Mason creates example single-table database of students and their grades across classes, considering: Students, class name, class code, grade, instructor name

Analyze Trekkable, considering: Hotels, addresses, Accessibility Areas (ramps, bathrooms, doorways), Ratings.

- First, each pair creates a Google spreadsheet and shares with me.
- 5 minutes, one table.

Why are these suboptimal?

1. Update anomalies.  What if the instructor changes?
1. Insertion/deletion anomalies.  What if a student is added with no classes or removed from all classes?
1. Make the data model more informative to users.  Is this clear to read?
1. Space?  Sure, space.

Mason splits classes and instructors into another table.

Try the same thing for Trekkable:

- 10 minutes in pairs, TWO tables.
- What limitations are still there?
- Talk about primary keys?

Look back at original example, talk about many-to-many?

- Go through definitions again.
  + Table
  + Record
  + Field
  + Value
  + Domain
- Ask what was wrong with this one.
- Show ALT spreadsheet and ask what was wrong with this

Review things to do when building a data structure:

- Avoid update anomalies
- Avoid insert and delete anomalies
- Save space
- Make the data model more informative to users
- Minimize redesign when extending capabilities
- GREY AREA: Don't build a data structure for only one type of querying

Introduce spectrum of Normal Forms. 1, 2, 3, BCNF, 4, 5, 6

We're going through these one at a time, but you don't start developinga design at 1, then 2, etc.  You typically design at ~3 to start.

ALT is already in 1NF, but we'll move on from that because it limits future extensibility.

Show 1NF.  Show 1NF Clean.  Launch into definitions:

- Super Key (or "key"): a set of fields that will allow you to look up any record uniquely.
- Examples of a Super Key?  (All fields is one example)
- Candidate Key: a Super Key for which no subset of fields is also a Super Key.
- What is a Candidate Key on 1NF Clean?
- Non-prime field: a field which is not a part of any candidate key.  Which on this table?

2NF: No non-prime field is dependent on only a subset of a candidate key.  Show 2NF.

Ask for an example of a table with two DIFFERENT candidate keys.

Show 2NF Alt.  Still 2NF?  Subject to update anomalies?

3NF: Transitive property.  Tag line: "[Every] non-key [attribute] must provide a fact about the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key." A common variation supplements this definition with the oath: "so help me Codd"

Show MySQL Workbench examples.  Say "THIS is a data structure.  Been using the phrase a lot, but it's a definition of tables, columns, and domains.  This is what you want to build right, and this is what will be hardest to change later."

Types of joins?

Closing of class: things in your life that you said would benefit from databases:

- schedules
- homework(s)
- Online Thesauruses
- Organization of files on computer
- An app that allows me to input when I have assignments or other tasks to do and shows it all on a calendar
- An app that contained all of the known holidays and allows the user to input other important days that are not holidays

Fill students in on Dr. Warshaw's answer to Kickstarter.  Kickstarter's perspective:

- "*Parents and teachers can launch projects in collaboration with children under 18 only if the adult registers for the Kickstarter and payments accounts and is in charge of running the project itself."

CREATE TABLE discovered_genes (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT, number INT, name VARCHAR(255), PRIMARY KEY (id));

The "id" field is an incrementing field with no gaps.  However, the "number" field was copied in from an old (sloppy)
database, and it has gaps.  In other words, its records look something like this:

- 1
- 2
- 4
- 5
- 8

Write a query to return all of the numbers that are MISSING from the number field.  In the case above, your query should
return 3, 6, and 7.

If this is too difficult, you'll receive most of the points if you can create a query which returns the FIRST missing
number rather than all of them.

    %{Course Objectives:

* Learn the fundamentals of database design.
* Understand the differences between relational, document, key-value, columnar, and graph databases.
* Appreciate the deep theoretical underpinnings of modern databases.
* Learn about current implementations of database types and their acceptance levels in industry.
* Communicate with others about real-world modeling using standard language.
* Appreciate the role that databases play in all levels of technology.
* Equip students with a series of tools which they can use in future endeavors to:
 * save time
 * retain knowledge or information that they discover/invent, and
 * think more critically about problems which they encounter in everyday life.

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

* Design a data structure to model real-world objects and information (CS Goal 1.d.)
* Select the appropriate database paradigm for various real-world situations (CS Goal 1.f.)
* Build SQL statements to create, modify, and read from relational databases (CS Goal 1.e.)
* Configure databases responsibly through transactions and indexing (CS Goal 1.d.)
* Work together to control relational databases through the Ruby on Rails framework (CS Goal 3)
* Balance theoretical and practical trade-offs such as consistency, availability, and partition tolerance (CS Goal 1.e.)
* Apply a few advanced techniques for allowing databases to scale to millions of users (CS Goal 1.f.)

the class begins. The question will be removed at that time, so no partial
credit will be given for late submissions.

You will also be asked to "grade" each lesson. I will give out slips of paper
during each class (unless you all consistently bring your laptops, then we'll
do it online), and you will (a) consider how well you understood the material,
(b) rate it between 0 and 10 (10 meaning perfect clarity, 0 meaning you would have
learned more by sleeping), and (c) turn it in at the end of class.

Note that this is only meant to judge how well the lesson conveyed the
material. If you have other issues with the course, please do let me know by
other means!}

they worked.

The Internet is a welcome (and obvious) resource for assisting you with your
assignments, although for a few problems, I may explicitly ask you not to
look.  Somtimes beating your head against a problem has learning value.
However should you happen to find an exact solution to one of the questions
while surfing the webz, then don't copy it. Hopefully I've gotten creative
enough to avoid that, and I know I shouldn't have to say it.  See the
"Academic Honesty" policy.

If you have an excused absence on the day an assignment is due, you will
be allowed to turn in your assignment 24 hours after your return without
penalty.  Unexcused absences will not extend the due date.  For every day
or part of a day that an assignment is overdue, 10 points (out of 100)
will be deducted from your grade on that assignment.}
